# CP_Template-Bonebreaker

C++ template that I use for competitive programming on different platforms.
It has debug feature due to which it prints the required data only on local system when there is no online judge present thus relieving me from the headache of commenting the cout statements.
It also has debugging function for C++ STL i.e. map,set,vector etc.
I also added some of my pre defined functions.
